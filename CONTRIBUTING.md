## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We use a simplified Git workflow:

```
main (production)
  ‚Üë
develop (staging)
  ‚Üë
feature/* (your work)
```

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes...

# Commit with conventional commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding tests
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

- `feature/add-video-upload`
- `fix/quiz-scoring-bug`
- `docs/update-api-reference`
- `refactor/improve-progress-api`

---

## Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Commit Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Commit Types

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks (dependencies, CI, etc.)

### Examples

**Good commits:**

```bash
feat(auth): add Google OAuth login
fix(quiz): correct score calculation for multiple choice questions
docs(api): update enrollment endpoint documentation
refactor(progress): simplify progress calculation logic
perf(api): optimize database queries for leaderboard
test(quiz): add unit tests for quiz submission
chore(deps): update Next.js to version 15.3.3
```

**Bad commits:**

```bash
‚ùå updated stuff
‚ùå fix bug
‚ùå WIP
‚ùå changes
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

## Style Guide

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint rules (run `npm run lint`)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use arrow functions

**Example:**

```typescript
/**
 * Calculate user's course completion percentage
 * @param completedItems - Number of completed chapters/subchapters
 * @param totalItems - Total number of items in course
 * @returns Completion percentage (0-100)
 */
const calculateProgress = (
  completedItems: number,
  totalItems: number
): number => {
  if (totalItems === 0) return 0;
  return Math.round((completedItems / totalItems) * 100);
};
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- One component per file
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Extract reusable logic to custom hooks

**Example:**

```typescript
interface CourseCardProps {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  thumbnail?: string;
  onEnroll: () => void;
}

export function CourseCard({
  title,
  description,
  thumbnail,
  onEnroll,
}: CourseCardProps) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>{title}</CardTitle>
        <CardDescription>{description}</CardDescription>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        {thumbnail && <img src={thumbnail} alt={title} />}
      </CardContent>
      <CardFooter>
        <Button onClick={onEnroll}>Enroll Now</Button>
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible
- Maintain consistent spacing

### File Naming

- **Components:** PascalCase - `CourseCard.tsx`
- **Utilities:** camelCase - `formatDate.ts`
- **API Routes:** kebab-case - `[course-id]/route.ts`
- **Types:** PascalCase - `UserProfile.ts`

### Folder Structure

- Keep related files together
- Use index files for exports
- Separate concerns (UI, logic, data)

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

We use Jest and React Testing Library:

```typescript
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { CourseCard } from "./CourseCard";

describe("CourseCard", () => {
  it("renders course title and description", () => {
    render(
      <CourseCard
        title="Test Course"
        description="Test Description"
        onEnroll={jest.fn()}
      />
    );

    expect(screen.getByText("Test Course")).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText("Test Description")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for 80%+ coverage
- Test critical paths
- Test error handling
- Test edge cases

---

## Documentation Guidelines

### Code Comments

- Write self-documenting code first
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use JSDoc for functions
- Keep comments up to date

### README Updates

When adding features, update:

- Features list
- API documentation
- Installation steps (if changed)
- Screenshots (if UI changed)
