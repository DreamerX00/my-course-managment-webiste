**Fix:** See [CRITICAL_FIXES.md - Fix #1](./CRITICAL_FIXES.md#1-fix-prisma-client-singleton-critical)

### 2. 🔒 Security Vulnerability (15 minutes)
**Why:** Hardcoded secrets can be exploited  
**What:** Default auth secret in code  
**Fix:** See [CRITICAL_FIXES.md - Fix #2 & #3](./CRITICAL_FIXES.md#2-add-environment-variable-validation-critical)

### 3. 🛡️ Authorization Bypass (20 minutes)
**Why:** Anyone can access admin routes  
**What:** Middleware doesn't check roles  
**Fix:** See [CRITICAL_FIXES.md - Fix #3](./CRITICAL_FIXES.md#3-fix-middleware-authorization-critical)

**Total Time:** 45 minutes  
**Impact:** App becomes production-ready (security-wise)
