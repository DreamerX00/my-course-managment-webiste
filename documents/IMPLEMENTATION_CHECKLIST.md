---

## �💡 IMPORTANT NOTES

### API Design Decisions

1. **Enrollment is Automatic**: No payment required, just POST to enroll
2. **Progress Tracks Everything**: Both chapters AND subchapters
3. **Quiz Security**: Answers never sent to frontend until submission
4. **Idempotent Operations**: Enrolling twice doesn't create duplicates
5. **Upsert Pattern**: Progress API uses upsert for simplicity

### Database Relations

```
User ←→ Course (many-to-many via students field)
User → Progress → Course + Chapter
User → QuizAttempt → Quiz → Chapter → Course
```

### Error Handling Philosophy

- 400: Bad request (invalid data)
- 401: Unauthorized (not logged in)
- 403: Forbidden (logged in but not allowed)
- 404: Not found (resource doesn't exist)
- 500: Server error (something went wrong)

All errors return JSON with helpful `error` message for frontend display.
