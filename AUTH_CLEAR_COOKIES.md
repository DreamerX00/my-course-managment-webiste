# ðŸ”§ Auth Fix - Clear Browser Data

## Issue
You're seeing a JWT error because your browser has old session cookies from the previous database session strategy.

## Quick Fix

### Option 1: Clear Cookies (Recommended)
1. Open your browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
3. Click on **Cookies** â†’ `http://localhost:3000`
4. Delete all cookies (right-click â†’ Clear)
5. Refresh the page

### Option 2: Use Incognito/Private Window
1. Open a new Incognito/Private window
2. Go to http://localhost:3000
3. Try signing in again

### Option 3: Clear Browser Cache
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
2. Select "Cookies and other site data"
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Refresh the page

## What Was Fixed

### 1. âœ… Authentication Strategy Changed
- **From:** Database sessions (incompatible with middleware)
- **To:** JWT sessions (works with middleware)

### 2. âœ… Created `/api/profile` Route
- Returns user profile data
- Includes enrolled courses with progress
- Calculates total score and completed courses

### 3. âœ… Fixed Middleware
- Now properly checks JWT tokens
- Protects `/dashboard` and `/profile` routes
- Admin role checking for admin routes

### 4. âœ… Enhanced JWT Callbacks
- Stores user ID, email, name, image, and role in JWT
- Fetches role from database on sign-in
- Supports profile updates

## Testing Steps

After clearing cookies:

1. **Go to login page**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/login
   ```

2. **Sign in with Google**
   - Click "Continue with Google"
   - Select your account
   - Should redirect to `/dashboard` âœ…

3. **Test Profile**
   - Click "Profile" in navbar
   - Should see your profile page âœ…

4. **Test Dashboard**
   - Click "Dashboard" in navbar
   - Should stay on dashboard âœ…

5. **Test Sign Out**
   - Click "Sign Out"
   - Should redirect to homepage âœ…

## What's Working Now

### âœ… Authentication Flow
```
Login â†’ Google OAuth â†’ Create/Update User â†’ Generate JWT â†’ Redirect to Dashboard
```

### âœ… Session Management
- JWT stored in HTTP-only cookie
- 30-day expiration
- Automatic refresh
- Secure and httpOnly flags

### âœ… Protected Routes
- `/dashboard/*` - Requires authentication
- `/profile/*` - Requires authentication
- `/dashboard/admin/*` - Requires ADMIN/OWNER/INSTRUCTOR role

### âœ… API Routes
- `/api/profile` - Get user profile data
- `/api/auth/*` - NextAuth endpoints

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/auth-options.ts`
   - Changed from database to JWT strategy
   - Enhanced JWT and session callbacks
   - Better error handling

2. `src/middleware.ts`
   - Updated to work with JWT tokens
   - Proper role-based access control

3. `src/app/api/profile/route.ts` (NEW)
   - Created API endpoint for profile data
   - Fetches user info, courses, progress, scores

4. `src/components/navbar.tsx`
   - Added Profile button with User icon
   - Works on desktop and mobile

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "JWT Session Error"
**Solution:** Clear browser cookies (see steps above)

### Issue: Redirects to login after signing in
**Solution:** Clear cookies and try again in incognito mode

### Issue: Profile page says "not found"
**Solution:** This is fixed - the `/api/profile` route now exists

### Issue: Dashboard redirects to login
**Solution:** This is fixed - middleware now recognizes JWT sessions

## Architecture Overview

### Session Flow
```
User Signs In
    â†“
Google OAuth validates
    â†“
NextAuth creates user in database (via Prisma Adapter)
    â†“
JWT token generated with user data
    â†“
JWT stored in HTTP-only cookie
    â†“
User can access protected routes
```

### Middleware Protection
```
User requests /dashboard
    â†“
Middleware checks JWT token
    â†“
Token valid? â†’ Allow access
Token invalid? â†’ Redirect to /login
```

### Profile Data Flow
```
User visits /profile
    â†“
Frontend calls /api/profile
    â†“
API checks session (JWT)
    â†“
Fetches data from database
    â†“
Returns profile with courses & progress
```

## Summary

âœ… **All 3 Issues Fixed:**
1. âœ… Redirect to sign-in â†’ Now stays on dashboard
2. âœ… Profile not found â†’ API route created
3. âœ… Dashboard redirect â†’ Middleware fixed

**Next Step:** Clear your browser cookies and test!
